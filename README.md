## Deployed Application
This application is deployed here: https://allaroundd.github.io/codequiz/

## Project
The project was to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive.

## Usage 
The user will need to answer multiple questions about JavaScript concepts against a timer.
For any incorrect answer, ten seconds will be deducted from the time. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over and then the user can save their initials and score.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## What I Learned
This project allowed me to incorporate HTML, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap. It allowed me to understand arrays manipulation better and incorporate localStorage. I had some challenges getting the highscores stored and retrieved but then I learned to use map.
